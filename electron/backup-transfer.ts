/**
 * Pure transforms for the backup document (export/import) — kept free of
 * Electron imports so the round-trip is unit-testable directly, like
 * sync-merge.ts and audio-format.ts (see tests/backup-roundtrip.test.mjs).
 *
 * The renderer's stores are persisted as zustand envelopes { state, version }
 * (see src/lib/persist.ts). The backup document, however, carries PORTABLE
 * shapes: settings as a plain key/value map and recent searches as a plain
 * string array. Reading the envelope's top level instead of its `.state` is
 * exactly what used to silently drop settings and recent searches from every
 * backup; these helpers unwrap on the way out and re-wrap on the way in.
 * Library and player stores already round-trip as envelopes untouched.
